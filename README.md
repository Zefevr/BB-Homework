# BB-Homework
First homework assigment of beginner bootcamp codaisseur:

I started adding the variables, I did not find it complicated here except for the part that the array of the inventory had to be decalred outside the object hero as the weapon. I left the inventory empty as I figured out that the hero starts with an empty inventory.

Then I started addding the functions, here I needed to spend some more time and research in order ti figure out what exactly was needed to do and the methods I had to use. Specially the last function doBattle..

Adding the interaction with the BOM: Here is were I spent the majority of my time, I decided to add the library of jQuery because I felt more confortable working with it. I also decided to declare at this stage the enemy obejt, decided to put it globaly because, why not? did not know what was comming after so I could always change it... I added the stylesheet so all the images have the same size, alse added the css file and use the cursor property so the user knows what is clickable. then added all the functions so when you click on the images they call the respective functions declared before.

I got a bit stuck here because the funcitons were not working as expected and I was getting many errors, but I think they work now as they should or at least close...

Finally I started to add the displayStats function so it would get updated any time any image gets clicked but even if the stats were being updated the rest did not work as exected... so I went on my research again and I ran out of time :(

I believe if I had some more time I would figure out everything but I am happy with my first project alone as it is my first time coding. I also have to say that I did not spend much time on the styele of the website becasue I was focusing more on how to understand and fix the main issues and left the style for the end.. but unfourtunately that never came.
